# Samplemania (and other stuff)

## Overview

This Repo contains some python tools that can be run on a PiBoy DMG, a raspberry-based gameboy emulator.

The tools are not games, but musical apps.

## Samplemania

This app is the main tool currently, it plays back samples (16bit mono wav) that are copied to the piboys memory (RetroPie/Files/Samples). It's not a musical sampler with sequencer functionality, but main focus is to quickly navigate a big sample library, playing back different samples on one of the 6 buttons of the piboy.
